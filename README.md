# MediLockr---A-Patient-Owned-Data-Exchange
A digital health locker built around patient ownership, zero-knowledge sharing, and smart  recommendations. Patients store all records in one place. Doctors get temporary, auditable  access via patient-generated codes. The system reads documents, categorizes them,  surfaces trends, and offers suggestions without leaking identity.
